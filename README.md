# Krrish Kumar
**Final-year CSE student | Backend Engineering | Distributed Systems | Open Source Contributor**

I focus on building **scalable backend systems**, **data-intensive services**, and **real-time infrastructure**.  
Currently preparing for **Google Summer of Code 2026**, with a strong emphasis on backend-heavy and infrastructure-oriented open source projects.

## Open Source & GSoC 2026

I am actively preparing for **Google Summer of Code 2026** by contributing to open source projects that involve:

- Backend APIs and service design
- Distributed and event-driven systems
- Databases, caching, and async processing
- Writing maintainable, review-friendly PRs
- Collaborating closely with maintainers

**Target domains**
- Backend infrastructure
- Distributed systems
- Data platforms and real-time systems

---

## Technical Focus

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Fastify
- **Databases:** MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL
- **Caching & Queues:** Redis, BullMQ, RabbitMQ
- **Real-Time Systems:** WebSockets, Socket.IO
- **DevOps:** Docker, Docker Compose, CI/CD basics
- **System Design:** API design, fault tolerance, scalability
